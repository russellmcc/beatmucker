This is a quick html5 demo using the web audio apis in firefox and chrome 
(through a third party library called "Audiolet").

The x axis is time, y is the delay length.  Drag the mouse to change the graph.

some cool effects:
 * "beat juggling" - draw horizontal lines on the grid lines.
 * "stuttering" - move mouse quickly in an upper right line
 * "vinyl stops" - create an arc starting flat and ending at 45 degrees.
 * "reverse" - create a straight diagonal line at more than 45 degrees from horizontal.
 * "slow down" - create a straight diagonal line at less than 45 degrees
 * "speed up" - create a straight diagonal line pointed down
